<b>Conclusions</b>

The map tells there are more universities in top 5 states of U.S than all the remaining states combined. Not only these states are top 5 in university count, but as per Wikipedia these are also the top 5 most populated states. There is obviously a direct correlation as more the universities, more the incoming students each year. Hawaii, a state with such small land area has almost the same university count as North Dakota and South Dakota and in fact more than double than Wyoming.
As per the bar/column graph most degrees are being awarded in health professions and related courses (more than those in computing and business management combined), which raises the question â€“ are there really that many jobs in healthcare industry?
Lastly, we can see the increase in tuition fee over the past 17 years in the time series. If we look closely, we see the gap between in-state and out-of-state fees increasing with about 1500 USD difference in the early 2000s to 2000 USD in 2009 and 3000 USD in 2017.
